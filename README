This is a program for drawing pictures of the dimer model on the hexagon
lattice.  Perhaps it is of some use to you?  Who knows.  

Use mklattice to make an input file, or start with some of the input files I have included.  mklattice can also be found on my github site.

It uses a graphical user interface, implemented in pygame.
